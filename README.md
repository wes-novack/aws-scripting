The file "functions.sh" is a collection of useful functions that can help you with querying for ec2 instance properties and to help with easily switching between awscli named profiles. I add these functions to my .bashrc file so that I can easily call them from the command line.

The script "stop_start_ec2.sh" can be used to easily stop and then start instances from the command line.

## FAQ

### Will this work on Windows?

Yes! You can install the aws-cli on Windows and these scripts have been tested to work on both cygwin and Windows Subsystem for Linux.
